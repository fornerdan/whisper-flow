## Tips

- Use a clean desktop wallpaper for macOS screenshots
- Ensure no personal information is visible (names, emails, etc.)
- Use realistic but fabricated transcription content
- Show the app in light mode as the primary set; optionally add dark mode variants
- Capture at native resolution (Retina) for best quality
- Use Xcode Simulator for iOS screenshots with sample data
